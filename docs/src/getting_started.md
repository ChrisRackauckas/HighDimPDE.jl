# Getting started

## General workflow
The general workflow for using `HighDimPDE.jl` is as follows:

- Define a Partial Integro Differential Equation problem. Two problem types are available:
```@autodocs
Modules = [HighDimPDE]
Pages   = ["HighDimPDE.jl"]
```
- Select a solver algorithm
- Solve the problem.

See the tutorials to learn how to use the available solvers.
