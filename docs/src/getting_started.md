# Getting started

## General workflow
The general workflow for using `HighDimPDE.jl` is as follows:

- Define a Partial Integro Differential Equation problem. Two problem types are available:
```@docs
PIDEProblem
TerminalPDEProblem
```
- Select a solver algorithm
- Solve the problem.

See the tutorials to learn how to use the available solvers.
